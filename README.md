# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my daily learning journey with **Python** and essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  
Goal: Step by step from the basics to building my own mini projects.

## Mini Projects

- **Temperature Converter**: A simple program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.  
- **Titanic EDA**: Basic Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations on the Titanic dataset.  
- **Life Tracker**: A desktop task management app built with **PyQt6**, following the **MVC pattern**, featuring task addition, deletion, and status toggling with persistent CSV storage.
